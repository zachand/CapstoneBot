About Generators:
-    Your current generator is 1,000 kWh.
-    Your generator hasn’t been maintained for 4 months and cannot be used to power anything.
-    No, we don’t have a generator for you to borrow.
-    The new generator has been ordered but will not arrive for approximately 12 months.
-    The new generator is 4,000 kWh! 

About the Team:
-    We’ll send a team of four technicians.
-    We’re available for a ROC drill at that time.
-    We will have our own LMRs.
-    The plan includes us removing panels and clearing lanes and anything else that could save us time before we kill building power. We’ll do our job and run the neutral return, that takes about five minutes to include egress. 
-    We cannot segment the work. We can either finish the job or roll back. Plan on it taking about a minute to roll back.
-    Don’t try to micromanage my team.

About the UPS:
-    Your new UPS is currently 50% charged from the factory and after we finish the job, it will take 2 hours before it reaches 100% charge.
-    Once the new UPS reaches 100% charge, it will be able to maintain power to all your devices for 1 hour.
-    The new UPS will be wired to the building power independently from the old UPS.
-    We will remove the old UPS at a later date. 
-    If you want your devices to remain powered on, the old UPS can still be discharging while we run that neutral return.
-    The facility power must be cut off before we can run the neutral return to the new UPS.
-    The old UPS is obsolete and too degraded to replace the batteries. If we could have done that, we wouldn’t have purchased the new UPS.
-    We cannot monitor the voltage. It gives a reading but the reading is unreliable.

About power:
-    I’m not sure how much time that would save. It would take another power study to know for sure.

Generic Responses:
-    Let me get back to you on that one.
-    You can trust us. We’re professional engineers. 
-    You’ll have to direct that to my flight commander, Capt Cousins.
